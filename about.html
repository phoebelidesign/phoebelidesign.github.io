        <h3>Phoebe is a Melbourne-based visual designer. Interested in finding harmony between digital precision and the organic, she often blends a structured, industrial design approach focused on geometry and functionality, with a more abstract and experimental style that explores materiality. 
            She values attention to detail and enjoys incorporating tactile methods such as printmaking, analogue photography and collage into her work, bringing to it a sense of warmth and texture.
            <br>
            <br>
            She studied Graphic Design and User Experience Design at the University of Melbourne, graduating in December 2024. She is passionate about music, cinema, literature and a million other things because she is just like every other girl who develops a fascination for most things she comes across.
