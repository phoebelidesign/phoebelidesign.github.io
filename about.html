        <h1>About</h1>
        <h3>Phoebe is a Melbourne based graphic designer. She has always been interested in finding a harmony between digital precision and organic techniques - blending a structured, industrial design approach focused on geometry and functionality, with a more abstract and experimental style which explores materiality. 
            She values attention to detail and often incorporates tactile methods such as printmaking, analogue photography and collage into her work, bringing warmth and texture to projects.
