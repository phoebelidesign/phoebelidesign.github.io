                <p>Entering the world an identical twin, I have always found the dual nature of identity to be an intriguing subject. <em>Counterpart</em> is an experimental publication exploring the notion of existing as a constituent of a whole, reflecting on the lived experience of twinhood. It contemplates the delicate balance between symmetry and duality, where the self is simultaneously distinct and deeply linked to another.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Acknowledging the complexities of this existence, I consider how this dynamic intertwines with a broader narrative - one where twin identity is often misunderstood, oversimplified, and commodified by the wider world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The newspaper format serves as a vessel that mirrors the accessibility and misinterpretation of twin identity. Through this medium, <em>Counterpart</em> captures the inherent tension of being part of a larger whole, delving into the intricacies of an identity that exists simultaneously revealed and concealed.
