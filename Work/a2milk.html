                <h2>Brand identity</h2>
                <p>Steering <em>A2 Milk®</em> towards a more playful branding, the refined identity moves away from an uninspired, generic design towards one that better reflects the brand's passion and belief in their unique selling point, rather than relying on brand perception and reputation. Our aim is to highlight the product’s quality, yet avoiding positioning the brand as a luxury product, instead focusing on the aspects of their milk that justify the premium price. The identified brand values are: Authenticity, Wellness, Quality and Passion.</p>
                <p>The logo is a simple, minimal wordmark that highlights the brand’s quality, enhancing brand recognition.</p>
                <p>The colour palette of vibrant and rich tones aren’t flashy or overwhelming, conveying authenticity and wellness. The colours also align with industry standards, appealing to the broad target market.</p>
                <p>The primary typeface is bold yet playful. The secondary typeface is refined and focused, reinforcing the brand’s scientific backing. Paired together, they strike a balance between quality and authenticity.</p>
                <p>The clean and minimal illustration style is recognisable, reinforcing the brand’s passion and authenticity while also enhancing shelf presence. The gut visual clearly conveys the ‘easier on digestion’ benefit, showcasing their unique selling point.</p>
